# ðŸš¥ worker-badge

It's just badge - built with Cloudflare Workers

I'm a huge fan of badgen.net. However, I find the images fail to load quite often. I want to use Cloudflare Workers (+ KV and maybe Unique durable object where feasible) to rebuild it.

Most of the code here is originally from [badgen repo](https://github.com/badgen/badgen.net). Credits to them for building a very nice service.

The goal of this project is

- Eventually support all badges that supported by badgen.net
- Extremely fast but try to refresh data as quickly as possible.
- Exclusively use Cloudflare tech stack only for learning purpose.

## Contribute

- Install `@cloudflare/wrangler`.
- Make the changes.
- Test with `wrangler dev` or `wrangler preview`.
