================

It's just badge - built with Cloudflare Workers

I'm a huge fan of badgen.net. However, I find the images fail to load quite often. I want to use Cloudflare Workers (+ KV and maybe Unique durable object where feasible) to rebuild it.

Most of the code here is originally from [badgen repo](https://github.com/badgen/badgen.net). Credits to them for building a very nice service. 

The goal of this project is

- Eventually support all badges that supported by badgen.net
- Extremely fast but not try to refresh data as quickly as possible.
- Exclusively use Cloudflare tech stack only for learning purpose.
