worker-badge
============

Badges - built with Cloudflare Workers

A badget.net alternative. The reason I build this is badgen.net fails to load svg very often.

Most of the code is from [badgen repo](https://github.com/badgen/badgen.net). Credits to them for building a very nice service.

The goal is

* Eventually support all badges that supported by badgen.net
* Extremely fast.
* Exclusively use Cloudflare tech stack only for learning purpose.
